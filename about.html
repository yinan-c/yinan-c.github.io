<h1>About</h1>
<p>Hi, I am Yinan, a PhD student in Physics.</p>
<p>Since I started my PhD, I have been reading and learning a lot, by writing down tons of notes and worklogs. Most of my notes are Markdown files stored in an app called <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a>.</p>
<p>Since almost all of my notes are going digital now, it is not a bad idea to put them online. Also, I have been writing short articles in Chinese since very young, but hadn't had the chance to collect and share them with others. I have been thinking about starting a blog for a long time.</p>
<p>Now, I finally decided to start one, thanks to a great tool <a href="https://github.com/ahui2016/pyboke">PyBoke</a>, which makes it very easy to create a blog using Markdown files. I know other tools like WordPress and Hugo that can do the same thing, but I like the simplicity of PyBoke.</p>
<h2>About this blog</h2>
<p>This blog is created by a modified version of <a href="https://github.com/yinan-c/pyboke">PyBoke</a>. The original version is created by <a href="https://github.com/ahui2016">ahui2016</a>.</p>
<p>I write the articles in Markdown files, the templates and Markdown files I use on this website can also be found in the <a href="https://github.com/yinan-c/blog">GitHub repo</a>.</p>
<p>I use the theme <a href="https://newcss.net/">newcss</a>, and publish the blog on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>.</p>

<h2>What will I write here?</h2>
<p>I am interested in many things, including but not limited to: RSS, macOS softwares, Python ... As I browse the internet (mostly via RSS), interesting things will pop up and I am happy to share online here.</p>
<h2>Thanks</h2>
